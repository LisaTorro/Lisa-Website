<h1>About Me—Lisa Torro</h1>
<img src=“ltpic.jpg” alt=“Lisa Torro”>
<p>My name is Lisa Marie Torro. I was born and raised in Florida where I earned my Associates through Dual Enrollment with a 3.8 GPA, and my Bachelors in Cybersecurity with a 3.6 GPA from Saint Leo University. I then moved to the Chattanooga, TN area. I am CompTIA Security+ certified and currently working towards my CCNA. I am also the host of CyberJazz podcast, where I talk about everything tech with some relaxing jazz in the background. 

My goal is to start my career in an Helpdesk, junior system administrator, database administrator, network administrator or SOC analyst role. I’m looking for any opportunity to get hands on practice of the skills and knowledge Ive accumulated over my studies and self practice. I strive to make a difference in this world by protecting their information and assets while making technology convenient and accessible. The current landscape has businesses under attack from cyber criminals on a near daily basis, making it more important to find security focused minds who can protect against the loss of data for businesses and the customers who entrust it to them. 

I have knowledge of networking fundamentals, network security and hardening, problem solving and technical troubleshooting, secure software development, network and system forensics, threat research, and penetration testing. I have engaged in multiple Python and Java coding projects as well as practiced creating PowerShell and Bash scripts. 

During my Dual Enrollment in high school I volunteered at Gulf Side Hospice Thrift Shoppe in Lutz, FL. Here I set up displays, tended the cash register, assisted customers, and ensured a seamless shopping experience. 

During my studies at Saint Leo university, I worked as level one technical support for One Support troubleshooting internet and DSL modem connectivity issues. It furthered my experience with customer service as well as problem solving and critical thinking. 

In my free time, I love to play video games like Skyrim or Stardew Valley. I enjoy working out regularly and spending as much time outdoors during the colder months. I have 3 cats, 6 lizards, a snake, a dog, and plenty of pet fish and shrimp! I crochet and paint often as I am able, and try to enjoy life to the best of my ability.</p>
